if given a photo with 2048 or more resolution in one dimension,

sky needs to be low, so if you get close to the wall you can't see where
it is missing, -1 seems probably okay. Making wall higher, need to anyway.

with walls low, bananas are really high

take out less panels of sky, just 3 rings instead of 4, leave 5

sky egg is looking great, and can switch in other skies easily

beach_panoramic - water, duh. not bad, actually
factory_panoramic - good one. some water, but makes sense
pano_houses - not bad. 
pano_lighthouse - can see the seam, weird being on the beach, very similar to 
           beach, but not as good.
pano_observatory - keeper
pano_salt_lake - meh
pano_water_bldg - in the middle of a canal, weird, but kind of cool
